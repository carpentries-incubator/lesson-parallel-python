## Software Setup

### Details
This is an intermediate level Python course. We expect familiarity with the command-line, and that you are comfortable working with a coding text editor (like for instance, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)). We provide two choices for working environment: **conda** or **poetry**. If you are on **Windows** the prefered method is **conda**. On Linux or MacOS you should be fine with either.
